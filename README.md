Learn about WebHooks 

Webhook communication is achieved by sending an HTTP request from a source application to a destination application. When an event takes place in the source application, an HTTP request which might contain data relating to you the event is triggered. This HTTP request is sent to the destination applicationâ€™s endpoint. This is the endpoint, submitted by the destination application to the source application, for webhook requests to be sent to. The endpoint is often referred to as the webhook URL.
